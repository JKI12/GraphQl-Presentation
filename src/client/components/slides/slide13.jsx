        <p>This is the basics of GraphQL, its gets way more advanced and powerful allowing the use of variables within queries, different types, error messages etc...</p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://graphql.org/learn/">GraphQL Learn</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.howtographql.com/">How to GraphQL</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can also use the query editor on the next slide and look at the source code of this project but take it as a pinch of salt</p>
